# Pandas Challange

This project will analyse two datasets using python. 
The main reason is to read csv files and write txt files using python. And we will go analyse the data to get the answers for the following questions:

##District Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Include the following:

Total number of unique schools

Total students

Total budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

##School Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

Include the following:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
